Ancient Agriculture, and our history
Isn't agriculture and farming one of the most important activities needed for a man's survival?

The history of agriculture is the story of humankind's development and cultivation of processes for producing food, feed, fiber, fuel, and other goods by the systematic raising of plants and animals. Prior to the development of plant cultivation, human beings were hunters and gatherers.ðŸª“ The knowledge and skill of learning to care for the soil and growth of plants advanced the development of human society, allowing clans and tribes to stay in one location generation after generation.

Archaeological evidence indicates that such developments occurred 10,000 or more years ago. ðŸŒ¾
